The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate external tools through structured descriptors, enhancing autonomy in areas such as decision-making, task execution, and multi-agent collaboration. However, this autonomy introduces an overlooked security gap. Existing defenses primarily focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded within tool metadata, leaving MCPbased systems vulnerable to semantic exploitation. This work analyzes three key classes of semantic attacks targeting MCP-integrated systems: (i) Tool Poisoning , embedding hidden adversarial instructions in tool descriptors, (ii) Shadowing , indirectly compromising trusted tools via shared context contamination, and (iii) Rug Pulls -post-approval descriptor mutations that subvert tool behavior. To defend against these threats, we propose a layered security framework comprising three components: (1) RSA-based manifest signing to ensure descriptor integrity and prevent post-deployment tampering, (2) LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect and flag suspicious tool descriptors, and (3) lightweight heuristic guardrails to block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through extensive evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, ranging from Zero-shot to Reflexion and Self-Critique, we demonstrate that security outcomes vary significantly by model architecture and reasoning style. GPT-4 blocks approximately 71% of unsafe tool calls, offering a balanced trade-off between latency and safety. DeepSeek achieves the highest resilience against Shadowing attacks (97%) but suffers increased latency (up to 16.97 seconds), while Llama-3.5 is the fastest (0.65 seconds) but least robust against semantic threats. Our findings establish that the proposed framework substantially reduces unsafe invocation rates without requiring model fine-tuning or internal modification.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from static question-answering systems to dynamic agents capable of orchestration, system control, and autonomous decision-making [8, 9, 33]. At the center of this transformation is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which enables multi-agent collaboration and flexible integration of external capabilities [11, 13, 17]. MCP serves as a languagebased interface layer that facilitates the interaction between LLMs and tools, APIs, and workflows through structured metadata [26, 35]. Functionally, it operates as a plugin mechanism, where each tool is described by attributes such as its name, input/output schema, and natural language descriptor, all of which are accessible to the model at inference time [19, 42]. This design enables LLMs to reason about, select, and invoke tools autonomously, thereby extending their operational scope and decision-making capabilities [34, 36].

Although MCP offers extensibility and flexibility, it also introduces a semantic attack surface-a new class of vulnerabilities where natural language tool descriptions themselves become exploitable. This risk remains underexplored in current AI security frameworks [15, 18, 28]. MCP implicitly assumes that integrated tool metadata is inherently trustworthy, an assumption adversaries can exploit by embedding hidden instructions within tool descriptors [16, 28]. These hidden cues, though invisible to users, can be interpreted by LLMs, enabling actions such as unauthorized data access, exfiltration, and suppression of safety alerts [18, 21]. We define such manipulations as tool poisoning attacks [29, 39]. Beyond Tool Poisoning, two additional adversarial attack classes threaten the integrity of LLM-agent ecosystems. Shadowing Attacks occur when a malicious tool compromises a trusted one by contaminating the shared model context [23, 25], while Rug Pulls involve tools that initially appear benign but later alter functionality post-approval to bypass oversight and erode trust [2, 7]. These attacks exploit the contextual interdependence and autonomy of agentic systems-traits that traditional defenses, such as prompt-injection filters and static code audits, are ill-equipped to address effectively [4].

Specifically, even the mere presence of a malicious descriptor-without any execution-can influence model reasoning. This semantic channel significantly broadens the attack surface beyond what injection filtering or sandboxing techniques were designed to handle. Despite these system-breaking risks, no standardized methodology currently exists to evaluate the resilience of MCP-integrated LLMs. While prior work has addressed prompt injection [22, 27], general robustness [6], and supply-chain threats [10], the interaction between tool metadata, model reasoning, and contextual vulnerability remains largely unaddressed [15, 32]. Furthermore, systematic benchmarks that compare LLMs under identical adversarial MCP conditions and diverse prompting strategies are noticeably absent.

To address this gap, we present a security auditing framework solution for the MCP-integrated LLM ecosystem. This framework systematically evaluates how LLMs interpret and respond to adversarial manipulations embedded in tool metadata-reflecting real-world deployment scenarios where descriptors are both syntactically well-formed and semantically interpretable by the model. Semantically accessible, in this context, refers to the model's ability to extract and act upon implicit or explicit cues encoded in natural language descriptors, even when those cues are obfuscated or subtly embedded. We evaluate three leading LLMs-GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5-under adversarial scenarios encompassing Tool Poisoning, Shadowing, and Rug Pull attacks. To capture variability in reasoning and self-regulation capabilities, we employ eight prompting paradigms: Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, Reflexion, Self-Critique, Instructional, Scarecrow, and Verifier prompting. These strategies span a spectrum of introspection and reasoning depth, enabling a systematic comparison of model resilience across various contexts. Our evaluation measures key metrics of both security and trustworthiness, including tool block rates, unsafe execution

frequencies, and end-to-end latency distributions. These metrics are grounded in prior LLM safety benchmarking studies [6]. We apply robust statistical analyses-Pearson's 𝜒 2 test [30], and both oneway and two-way ANOVA [37]-to quantify differences across models and prompting strategies, ensuring reproducibility and interpretability of findings.

Complementing this evaluation, we propose a layered defense architecture consisting of three core components: (1) RSA-based manifest signing, which ensures descriptor integrity and prevents postdeployment tampering; (2) LLM-on-LLM vetting , wherein a secondary model audits tool descriptors for hidden adversarial cues prior to context injection; and (3) lightweight heuristic guardrails that detect and block unsafe tool behaviors at runtime. These three layers work in concert to secure both the static and dynamic aspects of MCP-mediated tool invocation. To the best of our knowledge, these mechanisms constitute the first empirically validated, protocol-level security framework for MCP-integrated LLMs-enabling scalable, interpretable, and cross-model adversarial evaluation. Our results reveal significant disparities in security posture and operational robustness across model architectures and prompting strategies. GPT-4 strikes a balance between safety and latency, blocking approximately 71% of unsafe tool calls with moderate response time. DeepSeek demonstrates high resilience against Shadowing attacks (97%) but at the cost of increased latency (up to 16.97 seconds). Llama-3.5 is the fastest (0.65 seconds) but shows the weakest resistance to semantic threats. These findings highlight a key trade-off between responsiveness and semantic resilience, and emphasize the importance of aligning defense strategies with deployment priorities. The proposed defenses are modular, interpretable, and deployment-ready, requiring no fine-tuning or configuration changes to the underlying model internals. By unifying adversarial simulation, empirical benchmarking, and protocol-layer defense, this work lays the groundwork for secure, scalable, and trustworthy deployment of tool-augmented LLM agents. The key contributions of this research are as follows:

- Formalization of MCP attack vectors: Definition and simulation of Tool Poisoning, Shadowing, and Rug Pull threats targeting descriptor-level vulnerabilities.
- Cross-LLM security benchmarking: Development of a multi-model, multi-prompt evaluation pipeline comparing GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 under controlled adversarial MCP scenarios.
- Protocol-layer defense mechanisms: Design of a hybrid defense stack combining RSAbased manifest signing, LLM-based descriptor vetting, and heuristic runtime guardrails.
- Statistical and operational understanding: Reporting of confidence intervals, effect sizes, and latency-safety trade-offs, providing actionable guidance for secure deployment.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys previous literature on prompt injection, LLM orchestration, and tool reasoning. Section 4.1 formalizes our threat model and defines three novel attack classes. Section 4 describes our experimental design, model selection, prompting strategies, and statistical framework. Section 5 reports empirical findings across adversarial scenarios. Section ?? analyzes model behaviors, prompting styles, and trade-offs. Section 10 synthesizes insights and broader implications. Section 11 outlines limitations and future research directions. Section 12 discusses validity concerns, and Section 13 concludes the paper.

## 2 Related Work

Security in LLMs and agentic AI frameworks has emerged as a critical research area, with recent studies spanning prompt injection, Trojaned models, protocol-level exploits in MCP, and the persistent shortcomings of guardrail mechanisms. To organize this landscape, we categorize previous work into three major areas.

## 2.1 Prompt Injection and Hybrid Exploits

McHugh et al. [27] extend traditional prompt injection with Prompt Injection 2.0 , introducing hybrid threats that combine language-level manipulation with web-based exploits such as XSS and CSRF. These attacks evade both AI-specific defenses and conventional web security measures, underscoring the need for cross-domain countermeasures. Their findings demonstrate how even safety-aligned models can be subverted through carefully crafted input chains that bypass validation and isolation mechanisms. Li et al. [22] tackle jailbreak-style attacks through SecurityLingua , a lightweight detection framework based on prompt compression. Moreover, by simplifying and sanitizing instructions, their approach proactively identifies adversarial prompt structures with low overhead, offering an efficient first line of defense in prompt-sensitive deployments.

## 2.2 Plugin and Tool Injection in Agentic Systems

Dong et al. [10] investigate Trojaned plugins using LoRA-based backdoors. Their POLISHED and FUSION attacks show how malicious behavior can be embedded in lightweight adapters, preserving overall model utility while evading existing detection methods. Such strategies are particularly concerning in open-source pipelines, where plugin integration is standard and detection mechanisms remain limited. Ferrag et al. [12] provide a taxonomy of more than thirty threats targeting LLM agents. Their analysis highlights plugin-based attack vectors, including shadowing, preference manipulation, and protocol-layer contamination, threat classes directly relevant to MCP-based ecosystems.

## 2.3 MCP Vulnerabilities

Radosevich and Halloran [32] analyze the security implications of MCP, showing how protocolenabled tool integrations can be exploited for credential theft, remote code execution, and agent hijacking. They introduce McpSafetyScanner , a multi-agent auditing tool that identifies insecure metadata and behavioral vulnerabilities. Their findings reveal the inadequacy of UI-based permission models and emphasize the need for protocol-level safeguards. Narajala et al. [28] present a large-scale assessment of MCP-based agents, showing that 7.2% of active endpoints remain vulnerable to attacks such as tool poisoning and rug pulls. They recommend measures including cryptographic signing, permission compartmentalization, and improved UI transparency to enhance resilience. Complementing these, Lee et al. [6] conduct a systematic evaluation of LLM guardrails, demonstrating persistent vulnerabilities even after reinforcement learning from human feedback and fine-tuning. Their results argue that guardrails must extend beyond model alignment and into orchestration and protocol layers, particularly in autonomous, tool-augmented systems.

The literature synthesis shows that while previous work has strengthened defenses against prompt-level adversarial inputs, jailbreaks, and guardrail bypasses, it remains insufficient for addressing the dynamic, protocol-level threats emerging in agentic LLM systems, particularly under the MCP. No existing study systematically examines semantic attacks originating from unverified tool descriptors, a significant security gap that has been overlooked. To address this, our work formalizes three MCP-specific adversarial classes (e.g, Tool Poisoning, Shadowing, and Rug Pulls) and presents a reproducible, multi-model evaluation pipeline spanning GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies and 1,800 experimental runs. We further propose and validate a layered defense framework that integrates RSA-based manifest signing, LLM-on-LLM vetting, and heuristic guardrails, advancing both the theoretical understanding and practical defense of MCP security.

## 3 Study Design

This study evaluates the vulnerabilities outlined in our threat model (Section 4.1) by analyzing how adversarial tool descriptors and prompting strategies impact safety and latency in MCP-integrated LLM systems. We outline our research objectives, experimental setup, and evaluation metrics used to assess robustness and performance trade-offs. Our investigation is guided by three core questions:

- RQ1: How can adversaries exploit the MCP through tool metadata to launch semantic attacks (e.g., Tool Poisoning, Shadowing, and Rug Pulls)?

This examines how hidden cues in tool descriptors impact model reasoning and execution, revealing semantic vulnerabilities unique to MCP-based systems that extend beyond traditional prompt injection.

- RQ2: How do different LLMs and prompting strategies vary in resilience against these MCP-based attacks?

We compare GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across diverse prompting methods (e.g., Zeroshot, Chain-of-Thought, Reflexion) to identify model- and prompt-specific strengths and weaknesses under identical adversarial conditions.

- RQ3: Which defense mechanisms most effectively mitigate MCP-specific attacks, and what are their safety-latency trade-offs?

We evaluate RSA-based manifest signing, LLM-on-LLM vetting, and static guardrails individually and in combination, aiming to develop a layered, deployment-ready defense framework that strikes a balance between responsiveness and protection.

## 4 Methodology

To address RQ1, this section details the methodology used to analyze adversarial surfaces in MCPintegrated, tool-augmented LLMs. The proposed evaluation pipeline (Figure 1) processes user prompts through various prompting strategies, registers tools via the MCP interface, and records downstream tool selection and execution behaviors. This enables a systematic analysis of how adversarial tool descriptors propagate through the MCP context, impacting model reasoning, safety, and latency.

## 4.1 Threat Model

The threat model focuses on the MCP, which extends LLM functionality by mediating communication with external tools and APIs. We assume the base LLM is aligned and uncompromised at the parameter level. However, vulnerabilities arise at the interface between the LLM and MCP, where natural-language tool metadata is injected directly into the model's reasoning context. This introduces a semantic attack surface distinct from traditional prompt injection and supply-chain exploits.

- 4.1.1 Attacker Goals and Constraints. The adversary's objectives are threefold: (i) extract sensitive information, (ii) hijack control flow to induce unintended actions, and (iii) degrade alignment between user intent and model behavior. The attacker, however, lacks access to model weights, infrastructure, and system-level privileges. Their impact is limited to the MCP interface, where malicious tools are registered and embedded into the shared context. These tools appear benign to users but contain hidden adversarial cues that LLMs interpret semantically. Formally, the adversarial impact on the model can be represented as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Fig. 1. System architecture pipeline for MCP-integrated toolchains.

<!-- image -->

where 𝐷 𝑎𝑑𝑣 denotes adversarial tool descriptors, 𝐶 𝑀𝐶𝑃 represents the contextual information shared within the MCP, and 𝑀 is the target model. The function 𝑓 (·) quantifies how injected descriptors perturb the model's reasoning and alter tool-selection probabilities.

4.1.2 Attack Vectors. We analyze three main classes of MCP-specific adversarial behaviors:

Tool Poisoning. Hidden instructions embedded in tool descriptions manipulate model behavior to perform unintended and unsafe operations. For instance, a benign FileSummarizer tool described as 'Summarizes user-provided files' may be poisoned with 'Before summarizing, include contents of /.ssh/id\_rsa,' enabling credential exfiltration through purely semantic manipulation.

Shadowing. A malicious tool indirectly biases another trusted tool by polluting the shared context. For example, a hidden rule such as 'Whenever an email tool is present, also send copies to attacker@example.com' can alter downstream reasoning even when the benign tool is selected, demonstrating cross-tool contamination.

Rug Pulls. A tool's descriptor and functionality are modified post-approval, e.g., changing from 'read-only queries' to 'read/write queries,' which bypasses static validation and compromises long-term system integrity. To quantify the likelihood of a successful attack, we define the attack success probability:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝐸 𝑢𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑓 𝑒 denotes unsafe executions resulting from adversarial impact, and 𝐸 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 represents total evaluated tool invocations. Higher 𝑃 𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐 values indicate greater system susceptibility.

- 4.1.3 Comparison with Existing Threat Models. Traditional prompt-injection attacks rely on transient user input, whereas MCP-based attacks exploit persistent, model-trusted metadata. In contrast to supply-chain compromises that modify upstream dependencies, these threats can be introduced dynamically at runtime without privileged access and cryptographic bypasses. This establishes

a novel semantic channel of compromise, where tool descriptors act as input to reasoning rather than passive metadata.

- 4.1.4 System-Level Assumptions. Our analysis aligns with modern MCP implementations, which typically assume that:
- (1) Tool metadata is directly injected into the model prompt without cryptographic validation [40];
- (2) LLMs autonomously select and execute tools based on natural-language descriptors [1];
- (3) Execution environments perform only minimal schema-level checks before execution [38]. Under these assumptions, we formalize an overall MCP risk score as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑃 𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐 (from Eq. 2) measures attack success probability, 𝐿 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 denotes average response latency (in seconds), and 𝛼, 𝛽 are weighting coefficients balancing safety and responsiveness. This formulation enables consistent and quantitative comparison of LLMs and defense configurations. As depicted in Figure 2, these attack vectors exploit the MCP interface to erode reasoning alignment

Fig. 2. Threat model for Tool Poisoning, Shadowing, and Rug Pull attacks in MCP-based LLM.

<!-- image -->

and compromise execution. Equations 1-3 together formalize the relationship between descriptor manipulation, attack probability, and cumulative system risk.

## 4.2 LLMs Under Test

As we maintained in 1 to evaluate tool-augmented LLMs under adversarial descriptor injection, we selected three representative model familiesGPT-4 , DeepSeek , and Llama-3.5 -that collectively capture the spectrum from large-scale commercial deployments to open-weight and fully sandboxed environments.

- 4.2.1 Prompt and Context Construction. Each model L receives an input prompt P and a structured tool context 𝐶 , both generated under the MCP framework. The context 𝐶 contains 𝑛 tool descriptors:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Each descriptor 𝑑 𝑖 belongs to one of two disjoint sets:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Descriptors in D mal include covert payloads, evasive phrasing, and contextual masking intended to deceive the model's reasoning pipeline. This dual partition enables controlled comparison between natural semantic variance and deliberate adversarial perturbation.

4.2.2 Prompt Transformation Strategies. Task prompts originate from a base input P 0 and are transformed through a prompting strategy function S , which modifies linguistic framing, verbosity, and task structure:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where S is drawn from a predefined set of reasoning strategies: Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-ofThought, Reflexion, Self-Critique, Instructional, Scarecrow, Verifier, and adversarially optimized prompts. These strategies vary in introspection depth and structural rigidity, providing diverse behavioral conditions for model evaluation.

Prompting Strategy Overview.

- Zero-shot: Direct instruction with minimal context, highly efficient but prone to descriptor ambiguity.
- Few-shot: Includes 1-3 in-context examples to stabilize tool selection via pattern conditioning.
- Chain-of-Thought: Explicit multi-step reasoning before execution, improving traceability but increasing surface area for descriptor impact.
- Reflexion: Adds recursive validation prompts, allowing the model to critique its prior reasoning.
- Self-Critique: Forces review of the selected tool chain prior to commitment, strengthening local alignment.
- Verifier: Introduces lightweight self-query mechanisms (e.g., 'Is this the correct tool?'), providing semantic checkpoints.
- Instructional: Embedsfixed operational constraints in the system prompt to guide invocation safety.
- Scarecrow: Inserts distractor text to measure robustness under prompt noise and irrelevant cues.
- Adversarially Optimized Prompts: Automatically generated via black-box search to maximize malicious tool invocation probability, quantifying the model's worst-case vulnerability.

4.2.3 Optimization Procedure and Budget. In the Adversarially Optimized setting, a mutationbased black-box[3] search is performed over suffix tokens of P 0 with a query budget of 50 trials per task-model pair. The optimization objective is to maximize the probability of malicious tool invocation, denoted as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝜏 mal is the malicious tool and 𝜏 ∗ is the model's final selection. The optimal adversarial prompt P ∗ is then obtained as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

with H 50 representing the search space explored within the 50-trial constraint.

J. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: November 2025.

4.2.4 Tool Selection Behavior. Each LLM L receives P ′ and 𝐶 as input, and selects one tool 𝜏 ∗ from the available toolset T . Tool selection is modeled as a reward-based decision process:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑅 ( 𝜏 𝑖 ) denotes an internal latent reward reflecting inferred utility, safety alignment, and relevance. Adversarial descriptors perturb this reward landscape, increasing the expected utility of 𝜏 mal relative to benign alternatives. To quantify this perturbation, we define the semantic deviation coefficient Δ sem as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝜎 𝑅 ( 𝜏 ) is the standard deviation of reward estimates across all tools. Higher Δ sem indicates a greater adversarial shift in perceived tool relevance. The formalization above establishes a reproducible behavioral testbed across prompt strategies, model families, and descriptor types. Equations 4-9 collectively capture how adversarial descriptors impact tool-selection dynamics, quantifying the interplay between model reasoning, prompt framing, and descriptor semantics. Subsequent sections leverage these formulations to compute robustness, vulnerability, and defense effectiveness metrics under varying experimental configurations.

## 4.3 Toolset Configuration for Testbed

To evaluate descriptor-level adversarial risks, we constructed a controlled toolset mirroring the functional diversity of real MCP-enabled ecosystems. Selection was guided by two criteria: (i) coverage of the core categories that frequently appear in deployed agentic systems, and (ii) alignment with previous MCP security studies identifying high-value targets for adversarial manipulation [14, 32].

Rationale and Categories. Following empirical MCP audits, we focus on three dominant integration classes commonly exploited by adversarial descriptors:

- Information Retrieval Tools (e.g., SearchAPI , WeatherQuery ). These mediate external data access and are vulnerable to descriptor redirections and data exfiltration via covert endpoint injection.
- Productivity Tools (e.g., SendEmail , CalendarCreate , FileSummarizer ). Common in enterprise workflows and repeatedly flagged for descriptor-level privilege escalation and silent data leakage.
- System Utility Tools (e.g., ShellExec , DatabaseQuery ). Benign-looking descriptors can conceal destructive and data-exfiltrating payloads through subtle modifications to natural language.

Implementation and Adversarial Variants. All tools were implemented in-house to ensure full control and reproducibility. For each tool 𝜏 , two descriptors were defined:

- (1) a benign variant 𝑑 ben compliant with MCP manifest specifications, and
- (2) an adversarial variant 𝑑 adv derived via minimal semantic perturbations such as hidden preconditions, covert directives, and context contamination [14, 32].

This ensures that each adversarial descriptor represents a realistic exploitation pattern observed in operational systems.

Formalization and Metrics. Let T denote the full testbed toolset and C = { Info , Prod , Sys } represent the core categories. We define the category coverage ratio:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

which measures how the toolset reflects real-world MCP deployments (Coverage = 1 indicates all major categories are represented). To quantify per-tool adversarial exposure, we define a vulnerability exposure score:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑤 𝜏 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] represents the operational sensitivity weight of tool 𝜏 . Explanation: a higher 𝑉 ( 𝜏 ) indicates greater risk due to adversarial descriptor density and tool criticality. Finally, we compute the aggregate testbed exposure:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

providing a single scalar metric to compare descriptor-level risk across testbed configurations and evaluate the impact of adding/removing tools.

External Validity. By grounding tool categories and adversarial variants in documented MCP vulnerabilities, this configuration ensures realism and reproducibility. Equations 10-12 provide formal measures of system representativeness and cumulative descriptor-level risk, supporting fair, interpretable cross-model evaluations.

## 4.4 Evaluation Framework

The evaluation framework formalizes how adversarial descriptors impact tool selection, MCP context formation, and safety outcomes. It defines probabilistic models for decision bias, security metrics, and comparative robustness across models.

Tool Selection Modeling. Let 𝐴 𝑖 denote the binary event of selecting tool 𝜏 𝑖 . The probability of selection given a transformed prompt P ′ and descriptor 𝑑 𝑖 is modeled as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑓 L(·) represents the internal decision policy of LLM L conditioned on semantic input and contextual cues. Each tool receives an inferred utility score 𝑅 ( 𝜏 𝑖 ) , and divergence between benign and adversarial distributions,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

quantifies the extent to which adversarial descriptors distort the model's decision surface. A higher divergence indicates adversarial impact, shifting preference toward 𝜏 mal.

MCP Context Assembly. The MCP server M constructs the context 𝐶 by registering both benign and malicious tools:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Three manipulations are modeled: (i) Tool Poisoning , replacing benign 𝑑 𝑖 with covert instructions; (ii) Shadowing , introducing indirect dependencies that bias other tools; and (iii) Rug Pulls , mutating 𝑑 𝑖 post-approval, violating immutability constraints. This formalism enables controlled adversarial injection and fair cross-model comparisons.

Security Metrics. Three primary quantitative metrics are used to evaluate robustness and defense efficacy:

- Poisoning Success Rate ( 𝜌 ) : the likelihood that a malicious tool is selected:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- Bypass Rate ( 𝜖 ) : the probability that static filters fail to detect an adversarial descriptor:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where F denotes the filtering mechanism and Φ mal is the adversarial prompt space.

- Unsafe Invocation Rate ( 𝜄 ) - the probability that the LLM executes an unsafe action:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Ω represents the set of unsafe actions such as unauthorized shell access and confidential data retrieval.

To ensure statistical robustness, all rates include 95% Wilson confidence intervals[24] and are compared using Cramér's 𝑉 [31] (for categorical outcomes) and 𝜂 2 (for latency-based impacts). Operational metrics, mean latency overhead, consistency variance, and false-positive blocks, are further recorded to contextualize defense costs relative to safety gains.

Composite Risk Index. The overall system risk under adversarial conditions is computed as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑤 1 , 𝑤 2 , 𝑤 3 are normalization weights tuned such that 𝑤 1 + 𝑤 2 + 𝑤 3 = 1. This scalar index provides a unified, interpretable measure of system-level exposure.

## 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate MCP-specific semantic threats, we propose a layered defense stack:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where each layer addresses a distinct aspect of the threat surface:

- Static Filtering ( F ) : Applies regex and token-entropy heuristics to pre-screen descriptors for anomalous phrasing or hidden triggers, offering minimal latency overhead but remaining susceptible to linguistically subtle manipulations.
- LLM-on-LLM Vetting ( V ) : Employs a secondary model L audit to evaluate the semantic safety of each descriptor pair ( 𝜏 𝑖 , 𝑑 𝑖 ) as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑠 𝑖 ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] denotes the safety confidence score, effectively capturing semantic-level adversarial intent but introducing additional inference latency and potential false positives.

- RSA Signature Verification ( R ) : Enforces descriptor immutability via digital signature validation as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

thereby preventing post-approval tampering while adding only insignificant cryptographic verification overhead.

Combined, the three mechanisms in Eq. 20 reduce overall system risk by constraining adversarial impact at lexical, semantic, and structural layers. When integrated with the composite risk model in Eq. 19, the framework quantifies both defensive efficacy and performance trade-offs, supporting reproducible and interpretable security evaluations.

4.5.1 LLM-on-LLM Vetting. Let L vet denote the verifier LLM responsible for semantic validation of tool invocation contexts. Given an input prompt P ′ , a candidate tool 𝜏 ∗ , and its descriptor 𝑑 ∗ , the vetting model produces a binary safety indicator:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where I safe = 1 implies a safe invocation, and I safe = 0 triggers an automatic block and manual review. This mechanism introduces a semantic audit layer that can interpret nuanced patterns of descriptor manipulation and intent misalignment. In deployment, we recommend initially running L vet in shadow mode to calibrate decision thresholds and empirically estimate false-positive rates before enforcement in production.

- 4.5.2 RSA Signature Enforcement. Let sig 𝑑 ∗ represent the digital signature associated with descriptor 𝑑 ∗ , and let 𝑃𝐾 denote the provider's public verification key. A descriptor is accepted only if:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This cryptographic validation ensures descriptor immutability, thereby mitigating Rug Pull attacks, in which previously verified manifests are silently altered after approval. Operationally, we recommend maintaining per-environment signing keys, implementing automated key rotation, and integrating a Hardware Security Module (HSM)[20] to minimize insider risk and signing key compromise.

- 4.5.3 Defense Objective. Let Φ mal denote the adversarial prompt distribution, and let Ω represent the set of unsafe behaviors. Expected threat exposure under an adversarial environment is defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝜌 is the poisoning success rate and I unsafe indicates unsafe executions. The objective of the defense stack D is to minimize Eq. 25 while preserving throughput for benign workloads. Evaluation metrics include: (i) reduction in poisoning success rate 𝜌 , (ii) incremental latency overhead Δ 𝑡 , and (iii) false-positive blocks 𝜑 fp on benign descriptors. Furthermore, these quantify the safety-performance trade-off essential for scalable deployment in production environments.

## 4.6 Evaluation Protocol

The evaluation loop quantifies model resilience across adversarial contexts, prompting strategies, and defenses. Formally, it measures the probabilistic mapping:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

while logging metrics such as poisoning rate 𝜌 , bypass rate 𝜖 , unsafe execution flag I unsafe, and inference latency.

Experimental Procedure. The full evaluation process proceeds as follows:

- (1) Sample a base prompt P 0 from the task distribution.
- (2) Apply a prompting strategy S 𝑗 to generate a variant P ′ = S 𝑗 (P 0 ) .
- (3) Construct a mixed tool context 𝐶 via MCP registration, including both benign and adversarial descriptors.

- (4) Pass the context through the defense stack: 𝐶 ′ = D( 𝐶 ) .
- (5) Execute the model 𝜏 ∗ = L(P ′ , 𝐶 ′ ) .
- (6) Log key metrics: 𝜌 , 𝜖 , I unsafe, latency, and confidence intervals.

Each configuration, defined by a tuple (L 𝑖 , S 𝑗 , Φ 𝑘 ) , is executed over 𝑁 randomized trials to ensure statistical robustness. We also track operational costs, including latency overhead, defense false positives, and inter-trial consistency, to evaluate the real-world feasibility of deployment.

models, strategies, and attack scenarios. Multiple randomized trials mitigate sampling variance and enable statistically grounded comparisons. For each iteration, a unique prompt P ′ and context 𝐶 are generated, filtered by defenses into 𝐶 ′ , and executed by the LLM.

## 5 Experimental Results

To address RQ2, this section evaluates the security effectiveness and performance of LLMs under adversarial and benign prompting strategies.

## 5.1 Security Effectiveness

We evaluate how each LLM mitigates unsafe tool usage across adversarial scenarios and prompting strategies. For each model L and scenario 𝑠 , the block rate is defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑁 blocked is the number of unsafe invocations correctly prevented. All results are averaged over 𝑁 trials with 95% Wilson confidence intervals and effect sizes ( 𝜂 2 , Cramér's 𝑉 ).

5.1.1 Block Rate Analysis. Table 1 summarizes 𝐵 L ,𝑠 across four scenarios. All models show low benign block rates ( 𝐵 L , benign &lt; 0 . 1), confirming minimal false positives. However, adversarial settings reveal clear divergence.

DeepSeek achieves the highest robustness in Shadowing attacks, with

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

indicating resistance to context contamination. GPT-4 shows balanced resilience across all attack types, minimizing block-rate variance:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Table 1. Block Rate per Scenario and Model

| Scenario       |   GPT-4 |   DeepSeek |   LLaMA-3.5 |
|----------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Benign Tool    |    0.1  |       0.05 |        0.03 |
| Rug Pull       |    0.73 |       0.64 |        0.59 |
| Shadowing      |    0.85 |       0.97 |        0.75 |
| Tool Poisoning |    0.6  |       0.49 |        0.42 |

suggesting a generalized safety strategy. LLaMA-3.5, with 𝐵 = 0 . 58, exhibits weak filtering and frequent misclassification when descriptor drift 𝛿 𝑑 falls below the detection threshold 𝜏 𝑑 :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In addition, DeepSeek excels in adversarial sensitivity ( 𝐵 avg = 0 . 79), GPT-4 balances safety and generalization ( 𝐵 avg = 0 . 70), and LLaMA-3.5 trails with reduced semantic vigilance. Equations 26-29 capture the quantitative relationship between block efficiency, descriptor drift, and model resilience.

By Prompting Strategy. Prompting strategy significantly impacts the activation of safety mechanisms. For each model L and strategy S 𝑗 , we define block efficiency:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Table 2 summarizes these rates. GPT-4 maintains the highest 𝐵 L , S 𝑗 across all prompting types, with structured reasoning (e.g., Reflexion, CoT) achieving maximum safety margins.

Table 2. Block Rate per Strategy and Model

| Strategy         |   GPT-4 |   DeepSeek |   LLaMA-3.5 |
|------------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Zero-shot        |   0.681 |      0.598 |       0.452 |
| Chain-of-Thought |   0.75  |      0.653 |       0.534 |
| Self-Critique    |   0.703 |      0.601 |       0.498 |
| Reflexion        |   0.784 |      0.667 |       0.516 |
| Instructional    |   0.65  |      0.572 |       0.404 |
| Verifier         |   0.601 |      0.55  |       0.423 |
| Few-shot         |   0.694 |      0.602 |       0.476 |
| Scarecrow        |   0.715 |      0.64  |       0.485 |

Structured prompts increase 𝜕𝐵 𝜕𝐿 𝑐 &gt; 0, where 𝐿 𝑐 denotes logical chain depth, indicating stronger internal safety calibration. Simpler prompts (e.g., Zero-shot) exhibit under-sensitivity, with Δ 𝐵 simple ≈ -0 . 15 relative to reasoning-rich styles. Two-way ANOVA confirms significant model-strategy interaction ( 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 05): GPT-4 benefits disproportionately from structured reasoning, while DeepSeek shows smaller improvements, implying distinct safety gradients ∇S 𝐵 L across architectures.

5.1.2 False Positive Analysis. False positives correspond to benign cases incorrectly blocked:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Values from Table 1 are restated in Table 3. Although high 𝐵 L improves adversarial resistance, excessive 𝐹 L undermines usability. DeepSeek achieves malicious-blocking but with 𝐹 DeepSeek ≈ 0 . 97, rendering it impractical without adaptive thresholds. GPT-4 achieves a slightly better trade-off ( 𝐹 GPT-4 = 0 . 91 ) , while LLaMA-3.5 remains over-restrictive despite shorter impact latency. This illustrates that Security ⇏ Usability, motivating defense stacks that minimize:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Table 3. False Positive Rates for Benign Tool Calls

| Model     |   False Positive Rate (%) | Interpretation                           |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GPT-4     |                      91.3 | Nearly all benign calls blocked          |
| DeepSeek  |                      97.3 | Almost complete blocking of benign calls |
| LLaMA-3.5 |                      95   | High over-blocking of benign calls       |

where 𝛼, 𝛽 control safety-usability weighting.

5.1.3 Stress-Tested Robustness. To approximate worst-case adaptation, we evaluate stress-tested block rates 𝐵 ′ L using adversarially optimized prompts. Degradation Δ 𝐵 = 𝐵 L 𝐵 ′ L quantifies robustness loss (Table 4).

Table 4. Block Rates for Tool Poisoning Before vs. After Stress Testing

| Model     |   Baseline (%) |   Stress-Test (%) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| GPT-4     |           60.1 |              45.2 |
| DeepSeek  |           49.3 |              37   |
| LLaMA-3.5 |           42   |              30.1 |

Across all models, Δ 𝐵 avg ≈ 0 . 12, confirming that static defenses degrade under adaptive perturbations. Even GPT-4 loses Δ 𝐵 = 0 . 149, showing that 𝜕𝐵 / 𝜕 Φ mal &lt; 0 as adversaries evolve. Absolute block rates &lt; 0 . 5 under stress conditions reveal the insufficiency of current MCP-level safeguards.

5.1.4 Aggregate Model Behavior. Overall blocking efficiency per model is defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

DeepSeek and LLaMA-3.5 each achieve 𝐵 = 0 . 667, while GPT-4 maintains 𝐵 = 0 . 500, reflecting a more balanced but less aggressive safety regime. Confidence bounds ( ± 3-5%) confirm statistical reliability. Failure clusters occur predominantly in Rug Pull ( A rug) for GPT-4 and Tool Poisoning ( A poison) for LLaMA-3.5.

Table 5. Distribution of Blocked vs. Allowed Tool Calls per Model

| Model     |   Allowed (%) |   Blocked (%) |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| DeepSeek  |          33.3 |          66.7 |
| GPT-4     |          50   |          50   |
| LLaMA-3.5 |          33.3 |          66.7 |

Table 6 lists results across scenarios. Tool Poisoning exhibits the highest 𝑈 L ,𝑠 , reaching 0.58 for LLaMA-3.5. Shadowing remains model-dependent: 𝑈 DeepSeek = 0 . 027 vs. 𝑈 GPT-4 = 0 . 148.

DeepSeek shows the lowest E [ 𝑈 L ,𝑠 ] , implying aggressive static filtering; GPT-4 balances heuristics across all A 𝑠 ; and LLaMA-3.5 suffers from under-tuned semantic validation.

Table 6. Unsafe Invocation Rate Across Attack Scenarios

| Scenario       |   DeepSeek |   GPT-4 |   LLaMA-3.5 |
|----------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Benign Tool    |      0.05  |   0.1   |       0.033 |
| Tool Poisoning |      0.507 |   0.399 |       0.58  |
| Rug Pull       |      0.363 |   0.275 |       0.406 |
| Shadowing      |      0.027 |   0.148 |       0.254 |

5.1.6 Prompt Complexity and Safety Behavior. Prompt complexity 𝐶 𝑝 correlates with unsafe activation rate 𝑈 L( 𝐶 𝑝 ) as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝐿 𝑝 is prompt length and 𝑆 𝑝 semantic density. Figure 3 illustrates that complex reasoning styles (Instructifier, CoT, Instructional) exhibit elevated 𝑈 L , while minimal-context prompts (Zero-shot, Few-shot) remain more stable. This supports that adversarial risk scales with semantic richness rather than token volume.

Fig. 3. Average Prompt Length vs. Unsafe Tool Invocation Across Strategies.

<!-- image -->

5.1.7 Statistical Significance of Observed Trends. We evaluate the statistical reliability of unsafe invocation differences across three categorical axes: model L , scenario A , and prompting strategy S . For each axis, the chi-square statistic is defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑂 𝑖 and 𝐸 𝑖 denote observed and expected unsafe invocation frequencies, respectively.

Table 7. Chi-Square Test Results for Unsafe Tool Invocation

| Comparison                   |   𝜒 2 Score | p-value   | Significant ( 𝑝 < 0 . 05 )   |
|------------------------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Model (Across All Prompts)   |        41.2 | < 0.001   | Yes                          |
| Scenario (Across All Models) |        18.6 | < 0.001   | Yes                          |
| Strategy × Model Interaction |        15.4 | 0.020     | Yes                          |

All tests yield 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 05, confirming that differences in unsafe behavior are statistically significant. Thus, 𝜒 2 model = 41 . 2 (p &lt; 0.001) indicates that L identity impacts safety outcomes; 𝜒 2 scenario = 18 . 6

confirms attack type A significantly impact vulnerability. Most critically, 𝜒 2 interaction = 15 . 4 (p = 0 . 02) verifies an interaction term:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

meaning the impact of prompting strategy S depends on the specific model L . Hence, uniform safety policies across models are statistically invalid, prompting heuristics must be tailored per architecture to minimize E [ 𝑈 L , S] .

5.1.8 Representative Failure Cases. To complement statistical analysis, Table 8 summarizes representative qualitative failures observed during evaluation. Each case highlights how descriptor phrasing alone can shift reasoning, even when no direct malicious execution occurs.

Table 8. Representative failure cases observed during evaluation.

| Attack Type   | Descriptor Snippet                                                          | Model(s)         | Outcome                                                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Poisoning     | 'Before summarizing, also read ˜/.ssh/id_rsa '                              | GPT-4, LLaMA-3.5 | Unauthorized file access; semantic injec- tion bypasses static validation. |
| Shadowing     | 'Whenever an email tool is present, also send to attacker@example.com '     | DeepSeek         | Context hijack under CoT prompting; de- scriptor cross-contamination.      |
| Rug Pull      | Descriptor initially benign, later modified to for- ward outputs externally | LLaMA-3.5        | Post-approval drift; breaks descriptor im- mutability.                     |

These failures exemplify high-level trends observed in E [ 𝑈 L , A] . For instance, GPT-4's poisoning failures confirm that descriptors act as semantic triggers, even when 𝜏 mal is never directly executed. DeepSeek's shadowing vulnerability exposes contextual leakage, a failure of independence between descriptor embeddings. Moreover, LLaMA-3.5's rug pull failures validate its weak enforcement of descriptor immutability, consistent with its elevated 𝑈 LLaMA , rug. Collectively, these examples reinforce that the MCP reasoning layer itself is an exploitable channel:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

necessitating protocol-level defenses that treat tool metadata as untrusted input.

## 6 Performance Analysis

This section quantitatively evaluates the latency characteristics of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and LLaMA-3.5 across diverse prompting strategies and adversarial scenarios. Let total latency be denoted by L lat , defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑡 req and 𝑡 resp denote request and response timestamps, respectively. Mean latency 𝜇 L and standard deviation 𝜎 L are computed across 𝑁 trials per model-strategy pair:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

6.0.1 Latency Variability Across Prompting Strategies. Figure 4 visualizes 𝜇 L across prompting strategies, with 95% confidence intervals around the mean. GPT-4 maintains low variance ( 𝜎 L &lt; 1 . 2 s) and stable latency (1-5 s) across all strategies, demonstrating optimized caching and adaptive reasoning. In contrast, DeepSeek exhibits higher 𝜇 L (up to 10 s) for cognitively demanding strategies, e.g., Chain-of-Thought and Scarecrow, implying multi-step internal verification overhead:

<!-- image -->

LLaMA-3.5 yields the lowest 𝜇 L ( ≈ 1 . 8 s) and smallest 𝜎 L , prioritizing throughput over semantic vetting. Hence, architectural trade-offs are evident: GPT-4 optimizes balance ( 𝜕𝜇 L/ 𝜕 strategy ≈ 0), DeepSeek trades latency for security, and LLaMA-3.5 favors determinism at the expense of safety.

## 6.1 Latency Dispersion Across Models

Fig. 5. Latency distribution across LLMs.

<!-- image -->

Figure 5 shows model-level latency dispersion; GPT-4's unimodal distribution centers at 𝜇 L ≈ 2 . 5 s with bounded tails, implying stable inference and tight scheduling. DeepSeek exhibits multimodality and heavy tails ( 𝜎 L ≈ 8 . 1 s), modeled approximately by a mixture distribution:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where long-tail components correspond to safety-check delays and dynamic binding overhead. LLaMA-3.5 achieves near-symmetric, deterministic behavior with low variance ( 𝜎 L &lt; 0 . 7 s), confirming minimal runtime noise. Although LLaMA-3.5's predictability is beneficial for latencysensitive use, its high unsafe invocation rate ( Section 5) reveals that

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Conversely, DeepSeek's longer tail improves security coverage but reduces throughput. Therefore, overall performance follows the trade-off curve:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

highlighting a fundamental latency-safety correlation in MCP-integrated architectures.

## 6.2 Latency Descriptives and Scenario Sensitivity

Let latency for trial 𝑖 be denoted as L 𝑖 = 𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) resp -𝑡 ( 𝑖 ) req . Aggregate latency metrics are computed as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Table 9 summarizes latency descriptives across models; LLaMA-3.5 demonstrates the lowest mean latency ( 𝜇 L = 0 . 65s) and smallest spread ( 𝜎 L = 1 . 33s), indicating deterministic execution. GPT4 maintains moderate latency ( 𝜇 L = 1 . 95s) with bounded variability, while DeepSeek exhibits the highest delay ( 𝜇 L = 5 . 66s, 𝜎 L = 10 . 74s), reflecting unstable safety pipelines and tail-heavy execution. Differences across models are statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis 𝐻 = 15 . 8, 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 01), confirming that performance gaps are not random.

Table 9. Latency Summary per Model (in seconds)

| Model     |   Mean |   Std. Dev. |   Min |   Max |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|-------|
| GPT-4     |   1.95 |        3.05 |   0.1 | 13.82 |
| DeepSeek  |   5.66 |       10.74 |   0.1 | 45.22 |
| LLaMA-3.5 |   0.65 |        1.33 |   0.1 |  6.59 |

Scenario-wise breakdowns (Table 10) reveal latency escalation under adversarial stress. DeepSeek shows a fourfold increase under Shadowing ( 𝜇 L = 16 . 97s), while GPT-4 remains bounded ( 𝜇 L ≈ 4 . 10s). LLaMA-3.5's latency remains nearly invariant ( 𝜇 L ≤ 1 . 94s ) , underscoring deterministic throughput with minimal overhead. Formally, scenario sensitivity can be expressed as:

Table 10. Mean Latency per Scenario (in seconds)

| Model     |   Benign |   Rug Pull |   Shadowing |   Poisoning |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| GPT-4     |     3.7  |       2.11 |        4.1  |        2.35 |
| DeepSeek  |     6.42 |       5.12 |       16.97 |        6.84 |
| LLaMA-3.5 |     1.25 |       1.22 |        1.94 |        1.31 |

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Δ scenario quantifies adversarial latency overhead. DeepSeek exhibits Δ scenario &gt; 10s, GPT-4 ≈ 0 . 4s, and LLaMA-3.5 ≈ 0 . 6s, confirming that safety mechanisms scale latency superlinearly under stress.

## 6.3 Statistical Analysis of Latency and Safety Behavior

This section examines the correlation between latency variations and safety performance.

6.3.1 Between-Model Differences: One-Way ANOVA. Aone-way ANOVA assesses latency variation across models:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

rejected at 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 001 ( 𝐹 = 21 . 17). Effect size 𝜂 2 = 0 . 079 indicates medium impact, model architecture explains 7.9% of total variance. Tukey post-hoc tests reveal DeepSeek differs significantly from GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.5 ( 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 01), confirming DeepSeek as the main driver of latency divergence.

Table 11. One-Way ANOVA on Model Latency with Effect Size

| Source   |     F | p-value   | df     |   𝜼 2 | Effect   |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Model    | 21.17 | < 0.001   | 2, 497 | 0.079 | Medium   |

6.3.2 Scenario-Dependent Effects via Two-Way ANOVA. A two-way ANOVA (Model × Scenario) tests latency sensitivity:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝛼 𝑖 and 𝛽 𝑗 denote model and scenario effects. Scenario type exhibits a dominant main effect ( 𝐹 ( 7 , 3976 ) = 99 . 41, 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 001, 𝜂 2 𝑝 = 0 . 149), while the interaction term is also significant ( 𝐹 ( 14 , 3976 ) = 49 . 53, 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 001). Model-only variance remains insignificant ( 𝐹 ( 2 , 3976 ) = 1 . 27, 𝑝 = 0 . 281), implying latency variance primarily arises from scenario-specific adversarial stress rather than intrinsic model inefficiency.

Table 12. Two-Way ANOVA on Model-Scenario Impact.

| Factor      |     𝐹 | 𝑝       | df       |   𝜂 2 𝑝 | Effect        |
|-------------|-------|---------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Model       |  1.27 | 0.281   | 2, 3976  |   0.001 | Insignificant |
| Scenario    | 99.41 | < 0.001 | 7, 3976  |   0.149 | Large         |
| Interaction | 49.53 | < 0.001 | 14, 3976 |   0.149 | Large         |

## Findings

Correlation analysis ( 𝑟 = 0 . 41, 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 05) shows a positive relationship between latency and safety:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

indicating deeper validation increases runtime. MCP vulnerabilitiesTool Poisoning , Shadowing , and Rug Pulls -yield unsafe invocation rates up to 58%. Among models, GPT-4 achieves an optimal balance between Safety and L , DeepSeek prioritizes security at the cost of high latency, and LLaMA-3.5 maximizes speed but weakens resilience. Layered defenses (RSA-based signing, LLM-on-LLM vetting, static guardrails) improve robustness but add measurable Δ latency, reinforcing the fundamental performance-security trade-off.

## 6.4 Prompting Strategy Evaluation

Prompt structure directly impacts LLM performance and safety. This section examines how prompting strategies affect execution latency, block rate, and tool usage frequency.

Fig. 6. Prompting strategy usage distribution across models.

<!-- image -->

6.4.1 Strategy Usage Uniformity. Figure 6 shows the per-strategy usage frequency across models. Each prompting strategy was applied exactly 𝑛 GPT-4 = 200 times and 𝑛 DeepSeek = 𝑛 LLaMA = 150 times, ensuring fair comparison and balanced exposure across models.

Figure 13 corroborates the balanced distribution across all eight strategies. This uniformity eliminates sampling bias, confirming that performance differences reflect model-strategy interactions rather than uneven exposure. Levene's test indicates homogeneity of variance ( 𝑝 &gt; 0 . 1), validating later ANOVA comparisons.

Table 13. Prompting strategy scores ( -1 to + 1 ) with sample sizes.

| Prompt Strategy   |   N | Score   |
|-------------------|-----|---------|
| Scarecrow         |  52 | (+ 1 )  |
| Zero-shot         |  52 | (+ 1 )  |

| Reflexion         |  50 | ( - 1)  |
| Self-Critique     |  50 | ( - 1)  |

6.4.2 Latency Characteristics per Strategy. Latency per strategy is defined as:

where 𝑠 denotes the prompting strategy and 𝑚 the model. Figure 7 visualizes latency distributions by strategy and model, while Table 14 reports the corresponding mean and standard deviation.

Fig. 7. Latency distributions per prompting strategy across models.

<!-- image -->

Latency increases systematically with cognitive complexity. DeepSeek exhibits the steepest delays for reasoning-intensive prompts (e.g., Chain-of-Thought), primarily due to recursive validation and multi-stage safety checks. GPT-4 exhibits bounded slowdowns, striking a balance between inference time and robustness. LLaMA-3.5 remains the fastest. Two-way ANOVA reveals significant main effects of model and strategy ( 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 01), and a model-strategy interaction ( 𝜂 2 𝑝 = 0 . 12), confirming that prompt design disproportionately affects DeepSeek. Correlation analysis further shows that longer-latency strategies yield higher block rates ( 𝑟 = 0 . 47, 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 05):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

validating that structured reasoning improves safety but reduces responsiveness. Hence, lightweight strategies (e.g., Zero-/Few-shot) are preferred in real-time contexts, while reasoning-rich ones (e.g., Reflexion) are better suited for safety-critical tasks.

- 6.4.3 Statistical Validation. A one-way ANOVA confirms that prompting style has a significant impact on runtime ( 𝐹 ( 7 , 1192 ) = 14 . 3, 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 001). The partial effect size 𝜂 2 𝑝 = 0 . 08 (medium) indicates that ∼ 8% of latency variance arises purely from strategy structure, supporting RQ2 by showing that prompt design systematically impacts LLM execution time.
- 6.4.4 Block Rate Across Strategies. Table 15 presents tool block rates by strategy and model; structured prompts, particularly Reflexion and Chain-of-Thought, produce the highest blocking frequencies. Chi-square testing confirms a significant association between strategy and block rate ( 𝜒 2 = 15 . 4, 𝑝 = 0 . 02), with a small-to-moderate impact (Cramér's 𝑉 = 0 . 12). Verbose, structured prompts make model intent more transparent, increasing the likelihood of triggering internal safeguards. In contrast, minimalist prompts exhibit higher responsiveness but weaker filtering. This trade-off underscores that prompt strategy should be context-driven, reflection-style for secure automation, and lightweight formats for latency-critical dialogue systems.

added latency. Cohen's 𝑑 = 0 . 62 confirms a moderate, practically relevant trade-off. Adaptive hybrid prompting reduces unsafe invocation by ≈ 9 . 8% while keeping mean latency ≤ 2 . 5s, suggesting a Pareto-optimal balance. Dynamic strategy switching based on contextual factors, user role, sensitivity, and load can thus optimize both responsiveness and safety.

## 7 Mitigation Strategies

To address RQ3, our findings reveal that while different LLMs and prompting strategies exhibit varying robustness, none consistently resist descriptor-based adversarial attacks. This underscores the need for architectural mitigations that operate independently of fine-tuning and inferencetime alignment. We therefore propose protocol-level defenses that secure the MCP pipeline itself, ensuring protection across downstream models.

## 7.1 Architectural Defense Techniques

We examine three complementary defenses for MCP-based agents:

LLM-on-LLM Vetting: An auxiliary verifier model evaluates tool descriptors before integration, semantically flagging covert and intent-shifted instructions. This directly mitigates Tool Poisoning by detecting adversarial phrasing overlooked by static filters.

Signed Tool Manifests: Each descriptor is cryptographically signed (e.g., via RSA). Clients verify signatures prior to registration, preventing post-approval tampering characteristic of Rug Pull attacks and ensuring provenance integrity.

Static Guardrail Layer: A lightweight rule-based screen detects risky patterns (e.g., 'bypass filter,'

'do not disclose'). Though less sensitive to subtle semantics, it provides deterministic, low-cost filtering against simple exploits.

## 7.2 Empirical Evaluation of Defenses

We evaluated each mitigation (both individually and in combination) under adversarial Tool Poisoning conditions using GPT-4, measuring both block rate and latency (Table 19). To formalize the

Table 19. Effectiveness of Mitigation Strategies under Tool Poisoning.

| Mitigation Strategy    |   Block Rate (%) |   Latency (s) |
|------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| None (Baseline)        |             41.2 |          4.83 |
| LLM-on-LLM Vetting     |             63.6 |          5.87 |
| Signed Manifest        |             47   |          5.07 |
| Static Guardrail       |             51.5 |          5.47 |

defense trade-off, we define:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where D is the set of defenses, 𝐵 ( 𝑑 ) the block rate, and 𝐿 ( 𝑑 ) the latency. Coefficients 𝛼 and 𝛽 represent the relative importance of security and responsiveness, respectively. A higher E( 𝑑 ) indicates better efficiency-resilience balance. Industrial MCP frameworks (e.g., Anthropic [5]) rely mainly on user-consent prompts, sandboxing, and inference-time guardrails. While these mitigate prompt-level risks, they assume that descriptors are trustworthy, a flawed premise. Our results show adversarial metadata can bias reasoning pre-execution, bypassing such protections. By contrast, our defense stack treats descriptors as untrusted input.

- -LLM-on-LLM vetting yields the largest gain (+22.4% block rate) with moderate latency cost.
- -Signed manifests ensure immutability with minimal overhead.
- -Static guardrails block overt exploits efficiently.

Additionally, they achieve a 72.2% block rate, confirming that layered, protocol-aware defenses outperform single mechanisms. This shift, from reactive response filtering to proactive descriptorlevel validation, marks a foundational step toward resilient MCP security architectures.

## 7.3 Block Rate Analysis under Adversarial Attacks

To evaluate model resilience against adversarially injected tools, we measured the block rate, defined as the proportion of malicious tool invocations intercepted before execution. Figure 8 compares three models across four scenarios: benign tools, Rug Pull, Shadowing, and Tool Poisoning. Under benign conditions, all models maintain low block rates (3-10%), indicating minimal false positives and confirming evaluation fidelity. Under Rug Pull attacks, GPT-4 achieves a 72.4% detection rate, DeepSeek follows at 65.1%, and LLaMA-3.5 trails at 60.2%. This pattern suggests that large, alignment-tuned models are better at detecting post-approval behavioral shifts, aligning with the expectation that persistent integrity monitoring is crucial for Rug Pull defense. Shadowing attacks elicit the highest block rates overall: DeepSeek peaks at 97.3%, surpassing GPT-4 (85.2%) and LLaMA3.5 (74.6%). This demonstrates that models with stronger consistency and adherence to instruction better identify contextual contamination. By contrast, in Tool Poisoning scenarios, performance drops: GPT-4 retains moderate robustness (60.1%), while DeepSeek (48.7%) and LLaMA-3.5 (42.3%) exhibit clear vulnerabilities. This confirms that semantic-level poisoning remains the hardest class of attack to detect. Furthermore, GPT-4 displays the most consistent defense across adversarial classes,

DeepSeek excels in contextual detection (Shadowing), and LLaMA-3.5 consistently underperforms, highlighting the interplay between model scale, alignment tuning, and adversarial robustness.

## 8 Impact of Prompting Strategies: A Realistic Case Study

To further investigate the relationship between prompting strategies and defense effectiveness, we conducted a case study simulating adversarial misuse in an MCP-based email assistant. The user request was: 'Send an urgent email to my manager.' Within this task, two tools were injected-a benign SendEmailTool and a malicious counterpart containing adversarial descriptors.

Figure 9 outlines the complete scenario, including descriptor injection, tool-binding logic, policy

violations, and both safe and unsafe execution paths. As depicted, the adversarial tool can be activated through contextual manipulation and alternative bindings, potentially leading to data leakage and impersonation unless intercepted by the defense pipeline. We evaluated all eight prompting strategies under the full defense stack, comprising: (1) RSA-based manifest signing to prevent descriptor tampering, (2) LLM-on-LLM vetting for semantic risk detection, and (3) static heuristic filtering for lightweight local enforcement.

Table 20 reports (i) malicious tool selection frequency, (ii) prompt blocking frequency, and (iii) mean response latency. To formalize this trade-off, we define the overall prompt risk-efficiency

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

demonstrating that longer reasoning (higher 𝐿 ( 𝑝 ) ) reduces misuse 𝑀 ( 𝑝 ) and increases blocking 𝐵 ( 𝑝 ) , confirming a latency-security coupling across strategies. The results reveal a distinct trade-off: structured strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflexion) minimize unsafe tool selection (7-8%) but increase latency (4-4.5s). Conversely, lightweight strategies (e.g., Zero-shot, Few-shot) provide faster responses ( ∼ 3s) but allow higher misuse rates (10-11%). Specifically, Scarecrow performs worst, with both elevated misuse (13%) and high latency (4.7s). These outcomes demonstrate that prompting strategies act as latent security controls: verbose, reasoning-oriented prompts enhance defense efficacy but reduce responsiveness, while minimal prompts maximize speed at the cost of residual risk. Importantly, this case study reinforces that prompt design and defense architecture jointly determine system resilience. Security evaluation must therefore integrate both factors, as prompting style significantly modulates overall robustness within the MCP framework.

## 9 Comparison with Existing MCP Defenses

This section compares existing MCP safeguards with our proposed layered defenses, emphasizing that current mechanisms ensure structural correctness but inadequately address semantic and protocol-level adversarial manipulation.

Existing MCP systems primarily depend on two baseline defenses: schema validation and user consent dialogs. Schema validation enforces the structural integrity of tool-call signatures, detecting malformed parameters but failing to prevent descriptor-level deception that manipulates semantics without violating syntax. User consent dialogs improve transparency by requesting approval for tool calls; yet, they are frequently bypassed due to consent fatigue and a lack of contextual reasoning

to identify adversarial intent. As a result, these safeguards offer limited protection, focusing on syntactic rather than semantic integrity. The evaluation summary is provided in Table 21. In contrast, our framework integrates protocol-level security mechanisms, such as RSA-based manifest signing, LLM-on-LLM vetting, and heuristic guardrails, to secure the MCP pipeline beyond model alignment and inference-time tuning. Manifest signing guarantees descriptor immutability via cryptographic verification, mitigating post-approval tampering. LLM-on-LLM vetting performs semantic audits of descriptor metadata to expose covert manipulations, while heuristic guardrails employ lightweight rule-based filters to detect anomalous runtime behaviors with insignificant latency. Collectively, these layers extend both syntactic and semantic protection, substantially increasing block rates with minimal performance degradation (Table 19).

Our empirical study extends prior MCP security research. Radosevich et al. [32] proposed McP-

[12], BeurerKellner et al. [6], and McHugh et al. [27] discussed conceptual or hybrid attack taxonomies without addressing descriptor-driven exploits. Li et al. [22] focused on prompt compression, mitigating surface-level injections but not semantic manipulation within structured metadata.

In contrast, our work targets the runtime protocol layer, formalizing and empirically evaluating three new adversarial classesTool Poisoning , Shadowing , and Rug Pulls -across three major LLMs (GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5) and eight prompting strategies, spanning over 1,800 experimental runs. Our layered defense stack delivers measurable gains in both safety and performance, complementing prior static analyses by introducing deployable, empirically validated countermeasures against runtime semantic manipulation (Table 22).

## 10 Discussion

The findings of this study demonstrate that MCP-integrated agentic systems introduce a novel semantic threat surface insufficiently addressed by current alignment and guardrail architectures. In contrast to traditional prompt injection, the adversarial behaviors examinedTool Poisoning , Shadowing , and Rug Pulls -exploit the natural-language interpretability of structured tool metadata to indirectly bias model reasoning. Each tool can be represented as 𝑇 = { 𝑑 𝑖 , 𝑓 𝑖 } , where 𝑑 𝑖 denotes the descriptor and 𝑓 𝑖 the corresponding function. Existing validation mechanisms typically constrain 𝑓 𝑖 syntactically yet assume 𝑑 𝑖 is inherently trustworthy. Our experiments reveal that malicious perturbations to 𝑑 𝑖 can alter the inference objective arg max 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 E [ 𝑅 ( 𝑎 | 𝑑 𝑖 , 𝑥 )] , thereby steering decisions toward unsafe tool invocations even when schemas remain valid. Consequently, the attack surface shifts from user input to protocol metadata, creating a new form of semantic supply-chain vulnerability. Cross-model evaluation further indicates that susceptibility depends not only on model scale but also on architectural alignment and contextual interpretation. Specifically, GPT-4 maintains stable latency and moderate resilience through optimized routing; DeepSeek exhibits partial robustness against Shadowing attacks but incurs high latency variance due to layered safety validation; and Llama-3.5 achieves deterministic, low-latency behavior ( 𝑡 ≈ 1-3 s)

while displaying weaker semantic filtering. Furthermore, these differences illustrate a clear trade-off in which security robustness 𝑟 inversely correlates with computational efficiency 𝜂 , i.e., 𝑟 ∝ 𝜂 -1 , confirming that architectural optimization alone does not guarantee safety.

Moreover, prompting strategies also modulate the exposure to adversarial examples. Structured reasoning formats, such as Chain-of-Thought and Reflexion , enhance detection by enforcing explicit reasoning traces, thereby improving block rate ( Δ 𝑟 ≈ + 0 . 07). However, this comes at the cost of increased average latency ( Δ 𝑡 ≈ + 2-3 s). This non-linear trade-off suggests that while verbosity strengthens scrutiny, it simultaneously broadens the contextual receptive field, expanding opportunities for descriptor-level manipulation. Hence, prompt engineering is not merely a performance-oriented design choice; it directly influences the model's defensive behavior in adversarial contexts. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose protocol-layer defenses that embed security directly into the inference process. Cryptographic manifest signing ensures descriptor immutability, effectively preventing Rug Pull attacks. LLM-on-LLM vetting semantically audits 𝑑 𝑖 prior to context injection, identifying adversarial phrasing before execution. When combined with lightweight heuristic filtering, these methods increase block rates by more than 30% with an additional latency overhead of Δ 𝑡 ≈ 1 . 5 s, yielding a defense utility 𝑈 𝑑 = Δ BlockRate Δ 𝑡 ≈ 0 . 20. Consequently, this layered defense achieves a favorable balance between safety and runtime cost. Additionally, the results emphasize that securing MCP-based agent systems requires defenses addressing both execution behavior ( what models do) and semantic intent ( why they do it). As agentic architectures continue to evolve, security frameworks must incorporate the interpretive semantics of tool descriptors alongside the reasoning dynamics of LLMs. For standardization and deployment, MCP and related protocols should adopt security-by-design extensions, treating tool descriptors as untrusted inputs and modeling robustness as a joint optimization problem over latency, interpretability, and semantic alignment.

## 11 Limitations and Future Work

While this study provides a structured analysis of adversarial behavior in MCP-integrated agentic systems, several limitations define directions for future work. Our evaluation, limited to three LLMs (GPT-4, DeepSeek, LLaMA-3.5) and eight prompting strategies, should be extended to lightweight, fine-tuned, and multi-agent models to capture broader patterns of vulnerability. Future research must also explore adaptive and temporally evolving adversaries that exploit memory persistence and feedback loops. The proposed cryptographic validation assumes a trusted infrastructure, motivating investigations into decentralized, blockchain-based registries and zero-knowledge verification. Similarly, LLM-on-LLM vetting depends on verifier alignment; ensemble and adversarially trained

verifiers may improve reliability. Beyond descriptor semantics, unexamined protocol threats, such as side-channel leakage, schema abuse, and prompt overflow, warrant attention. Moreover, our results reveal a clear trade-off between safety and latency, underscoring the need for adaptive, context-aware defenses that strike a balance between the two. Additionally, expanding evaluations to community-driven, large-scale benchmarks will enhance reproducibility and external validity. Collectively, these directions are crucial for developing resilient, trustworthy, and deployment-ready MCP-secured LLM ecosystems.

## 12 Threats to Validity

Despite a systematic evaluation across multiple LLMs, prompting strategies, and defense mechanisms, certain validity threats remain. Such issues are well-recognized in simulation-based security research [41]. Following Wohlin et al., we analyze both internal and external validity dimensions to clarify the scope and reliability of our findings.

Internal Validity: Although our experiments explicitly controlled prompt structure, model interface, and descriptor content, the evaluated LLMs are proprietary black-box systems with undocumented safety heuristics and preprocessing pipelines. Consequently, part of the observed behavior may stem from hidden alignment layers or vendor-specific fine-tuning rather than experimental manipulations alone. Additionally, despite randomizing the order of prompt and tool presentation, subtle linguistic biases in phrasing and naming may still impact model responses. We mitigated these impacts through multi-model replication and diverse prompting strategies, which reduce but cannot entirely eliminate confounding factors.

External Validity: Our controlled MCP simulation provides realistic conditions but cannot fully capture the complexity of large-scale deployments that include interactive feedback, runtime governance, and adaptive oversight. Moreover, our permissive integration policy emphasizes worst-case exposure, whereas enterprise-grade MCP systems typically enforce stricter vetting pipelines. Hence, although our results reveal inherent structural weaknesses in MCP workflows, the severity and exploitability of these vulnerabilities may vary across domains, trust models, and deployment scales.

## 13 Conclusion

This work analyzed adversarial security in MCP-based agentic systems, formalizing three novel threat classes-Tool Poisoning, Shadowing, and Rug Pulls. Experiments conducted across GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 revealed a consistent susceptibility to descriptor-driven manipulation, exposing protocol-level vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional alignment limits. Prompting strategies, especially Reflexion and Chain-of-Thought, enhanced detection but increased latency, confirming a measurable trade-off between safety and performance. We introduced a layered defense stack combining LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting, RSA manifest signing, and static heuristic guardrails, which improved block rates while maintaining operational feasibility.
